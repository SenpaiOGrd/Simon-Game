# Simon game

The Simon Game, developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, is a fun memory-based game where players follow an increasingly complex pattern of colors. The game generates a random sequence of colors, and the player must replicate the pattern correctly. With each successful round, the sequence length increases, testing the playerâ€™s memory and focus. The app features a visually appealing and responsive interface for an engaging user experience.
